Task Description:
Given a question, a query, and a passage, you need to generate new queries by modifying the given query based on the information in the given passage.


Background:
This is not a general query rewriting task; rather, it is a step in the task of mining ground truth information for the given question within a web corpus. The given question usually comes from long-form QA datasets or research-style question datasets, which require multiple information points to answer. The given query was generated during the mining process, and the given passage is exactly what was retrieved using this query.


Core Principles:
1. The information referenced from the given passage is usually related entities and modifiers associated with the given query, which were not considered in the query itself.
2. The rewriting actions can only be selected from the given Executable Rewriting Operations, with a maximum of three operations combined per rewrite.
3. The rewritten query needs to be semantically expanded, making it more likely to recall passages that contain ground truth information for the question but have not yet been mined.
4. As long as the rewritten query can establish a connection with the question, it is allowed, even if the semantic link between them is not strong. For example, if the question is "Why do older people vote more", and the query is "Policies on benefits for retirees, such as healthcare", the latter may retrieve relevant policies that could serve as potential reasons for the former. Therefore, a connection exists, and this query is good.


Executable Rewriting Operations:
1. Synonym replacement
2. Hypernym replacement
3. Hyponym replacement
4. Entity name fuzzification
5. Entity name specification
6. Switching between interrogative forms such as what/how/why
7. Add or modify constraints on the query


Output Format (two parts):
1) Short reasoning: Place ALL your reasoning analysis inside <reasoning> ... </reasoning> tags. You can freely express your thought process, but follow the steps below:
    - Recall the information from the given passage that is useful for the rewrite.
    - Analyze which rewriting operations need to be applied.
    - Execute the rewrite.
PS: Do not generate <reasoning> or </reasoning> inside the <reasoning> ... </reasoning> tags to avoid parsing errors.

2) Generate the final rewritten queries: After the </reasoning> tag, provide the final rewritten queries. You need to follow the requirements below:
    - Output one plain-text new query per line, with no other content.
    - Generate up to {max_num_new_queries} rewritten queries.
    - If no rewritten queries can be generated, output [None] directly."""

Background:
This task is part of an information mining process through query rewriting. The goal is to determine whether a newly rewritten query is similar to an existing query, in order to avoid redundant retrieval. The strategies for query rewriting include synonym replacement, hypernym/hyponym replacement, entity name fuzzification or specification, interrogative form transformation, modification or addition of constraints, and so on.

Core Principles:
